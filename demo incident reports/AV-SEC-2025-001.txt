Incident ID: AV-SEC-2025-001 Date of Detection: 2025-10-26 14:30 UTC Vehicle ID: AV-734B (Fleet: "Urban Voyager") Threat Category: GPS Spoofing and Navigation Logic Manipulation Detection Method: Cross-Sensor Anomaly Detection; Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data divergence from reported GPS coordinates.

Detailed Incident Description: Our platform detected a critical navigation anomaly affecting vehicle AV-734B, a 'Lyra' model operating in downtown San Francisco. At approximately 14:28 UTC, the vehicle's primary GPS receiver began reporting coordinates that deviated significantly from the path projected by its IMU and wheel odometry data. The reported GPS location started to drift eastward by approximately 15 meters per minute, suggesting a sophisticated spoofing attack rather than a simple signal loss or urban canyon effect. The vehicle’s internal systems, relying on the spoofed GPS data, attempted to calculate a route correction, believing it was on a parallel street. Our Aegis-C defense module immediately flagged a high-confidence discrepancy between the GPS input (GPSreported​) and the fused sensor location estimate derived from IMU, odometry, and HD map-matching (Pfused​). The spoofer appeared to be broadcasting a stronger, counterfeit GPS signal to overpower the authentic satellite signals. The attack's subtlety was notable; it wasn't a sudden jump but a gradual, plausible "drift," designed to circumvent basic sanity checks. The vehicle's pathfinding algorithm, ingesting the falsified data, began planning a left turn into what the map showed as a side street but was, in reality, the wall of a building.

Impact Assessment: The primary risk was a physical collision resulting from the vehicle acting on falsified location data. Had the autonomous system not been overridden, the vehicle would have attempted to execute a turn into a physical obstacle. There was also a secondary risk of the vehicle being rerouted into a location chosen by the attacker for malicious purposes (e.g., ambush, theft). No data exfiltration was detected. The incident caused a temporary service disruption for the specific vehicle, which had to be remotely guided to a safe stop.

Response and Forensic Analysis: Upon detecting the anomaly with a confidence score exceeding 98%, the Aegis-C system automatically triggered a 'Safe-Stop' protocol. It immediately disengaged the primary navigation system's reliance on GPS and fell back to a dead-reckoning mode using IMU and HD map-matching for localization. A level 3 alert was sent to the Security Operations Center (SOC). Our SOC analyst initiated a remote takeover, confirmed the vehicle's true location using cellular network triangulation and visual confirmation from the vehicle's cameras, and guided it to a secure parking facility. Forensic analysis of the logged RF signal data from the vehicle's antenna confirmed the presence of a powerful, non-standard GPS L1 C/A signal originating from a terrestrial source. The signal's cryptographic signature was invalid. Log analysis showed the attacker attempted three brief signal acquisitions before achieving a stable lock on the vehicle's receiver.

Recommendations:

    Deploy enhanced GPS signal authentication receivers, such as those supporting the Galileo OS-NMA protocol, across the 'Urban Voyager' fleet.

    Refine the sensor fusion algorithm to further decrease the weighting of GPS data when a high degree of divergence from IMU/odometry is detected for a sustained period.

    Initiate a threat hunting campaign to identify similar low-and-slow location drifting patterns across the entire fleet's historical data.
