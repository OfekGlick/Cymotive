Incident ID: AV-SEC-2025-003 Date of Detection: 2025-10-29 21:05 UTC Vehicle ID: AV-112D (Fleet: "Metro Shuttle") Threat Category: Sensor Attack (Lidar Jamming/Spoofing) Detection Method: Perception Layer Anomaly Detection.

Detailed Incident Description: Vehicle AV-112D, a passenger shuttle, reported a critical perception system failure while operating in a low-light, rainy environment. The primary 360-degree Lidar sensor began returning a nonsensical point cloud, characterized by a dense, spherical shell of phantom points surrounding the vehicle at a fixed distance of approximately 20 meters. This pattern is inconsistent with any physical environment and is a strong indicator of a sensor blinding or jamming attack. The attack effectively blinded the vehicle to its real surroundings, including other vehicles, pedestrians, and road boundaries. Simultaneously, the onboard microphone array registered a high-frequency sound outside the normal human hearing range, which is consistent with some forms of acoustic interference attacks against MEMS-based Lidar systems. The vehicle's perception stack, unable to correlate the Lidar data with inputs from its camera and radar systems, declared a state of total sensor degradation. The attacker's goal was likely to force the vehicle into an emergency stop, potentially for carjacking or other malicious on-site activity.

Impact Assessment: The attack resulted in a complete loss of the primary environmental sensing capability, rendering the autonomous driving function inoperable. The vehicle correctly identified the failure and performed an immediate, but potentially hazardous, emergency stop in an active traffic lane. While no collision occurred, the sudden stop posed a risk to following traffic.

Response and Forensic Analysis: The vehicle's safety protocol for critical perception failure was triggered automatically. It engaged hazard lights, broadcast a V2X warning message about its compromised state, and performed a full emergency stop. The SOC was alerted and immediately accessed the vehicle's camera feeds, which showed a dark sedan tailgating the shuttle moments before the incident. The sedan was equipped with an unusual roof-mounted apparatus. After the shuttle stopped, the sedan sped away. The Lidar system returned to normal operation approximately 90 seconds after the event, suggesting the jamming source was no longer in proximity. A forensic review of the raw Lidar data packets confirmed the presence of synchronized, high-intensity return signals that overwhelmed the sensor's detectors.

Recommendations:

    Accelerate the rollout of multi-modal Lidar systems that operate on different frequencies or technologies (e.g., FMCW Lidar alongside traditional time-of-flight) to provide resilience against single-frequency jamming.

    Improve the perception fusion logic to more gracefully handle the complete failure of one sensor type by temporarily increasing reliance on others (radar, cameras) to allow for a controlled pullover to the side of the road instead of a full stop in-lane.

    Develop a signature for this specific type of spherical point cloud artifact to allow for faster and more specific classification of Lidar jamming attacks.
