Incident ID: AV-SEC-2025-002 Date of Detection: 2025-10-28 09:15 UTC Vehicle ID: AV-991X (Fleet: "Highway Hauler") Threat Category: CAN Bus Intrusion / Denial of Service Detection Method: In-Vehicle Network (IVN) Behavioral Anomaly Detection.

Detailed Incident Description: A high-severity event was triggered on vehicle AV-991X, a long-haul autonomous truck, while it was operating on Interstate 80. Our network monitoring agent on the primary Controller Area Network (CAN) bus detected a sudden flood of high-priority, non-standard messages originating from an unauthorized ECU. The attack manifested as a broadcast storm of CAN frames with ID 0x1A0, an identifier not specified in the manufacturer's CAN database for this vehicle model. These frames were sent at a rate of approximately 2,500 frames per second, effectively saturating the CAN bus bandwidth and preventing legitimate messages from critical ECUs, such as the brake controller and engine control module, from being transmitted reliably. This is a classic Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. The source of the malicious frames was traced to a compromised telematics dongle that had been physically plugged into the OBD-II port, likely during a previous maintenance stop. The device was not on the approved hardware manifest for the vehicle. The flood caused intermittent loss of communication between the primary autonomous driving computer and the powertrain controllers, leading to jerky acceleration and deceleration as the system tried to maintain control.

Impact Assessment: The immediate impact was a loss of stable vehicle control, creating a significant safety hazard on a public highway. The bus saturation could have led to a complete failure of the braking and steering commands to be processed in time. The vehicle's autonomous system correctly detected the control instability and initiated a controlled deceleration to the shoulder of the road. No collision occurred.

Response and Forensic Analysis: The onboard intrusion detection system (IDS) immediately identified the message flood and correlated it with the unexpected control behavior. It broadcast a 'CAN bus reset' command while simultaneously isolating the OBD-II port's gateway from the critical control network. This action stopped the flood of malicious messages. The system then handed control over to its redundant, physically separate safety bus and executed a safe pullover maneuver. The SOC was alerted, and the fleet operator was instructed to dispatch a recovery team. The team physically removed the malicious OBD-II dongle. A forensic image of the dongle's firmware was captured. Analysis revealed a simple script designed to activate and broadcast malformed CAN packets when the vehicle's speed exceeded 50 mph. The firmware was of unknown origin but contained Russian-language comments.

Recommendations:

    Implement a strict physical security policy for OBD-II ports, including tamper-evident seals or lockable covers.

    Deploy a hardware whitelisting solution at the gateway level to ensure only authorized and authenticated ECUs can communicate on critical CAN buses.

    Enhance the IDS to not only detect message floods but also to perform faster source identification and isolation of rogue nodes on the network.
